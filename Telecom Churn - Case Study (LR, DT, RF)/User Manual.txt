In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers 
and actively switch from one operator to another. 
In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. 
Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, 
customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

Given the dataset we need to find predict the customers about to churn and also find the 
driver variables for churn..

The predictions are done on PCA treated data using logistic regression, and
for finding the driver attributes we used Decision trees to accurately find the variables 
influence churn.
