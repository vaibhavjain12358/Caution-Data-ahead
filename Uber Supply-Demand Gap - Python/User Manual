Business Objectives:

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) 
      and recommend ways to improve the situation. 
As a result of your analysis, you should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) 
      and recommend ways to improve them. 
      
Results Expected:

Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber. 

Create plots to visualise the frequency of requests that get cancelled or show 'no cars available'; 
    identify the most problematic types of requests (city to airport / airport to city etc.) 
    and the time slots (early mornings, late evenings etc.) using plots

Find out the gap between supply and demand and show the same using plots.

Find the time slots when the highest gap exists

Find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots

What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap?. You may accompany the write-up with plot(s).

Recommend some ways to resolve the supply-demand gap.
