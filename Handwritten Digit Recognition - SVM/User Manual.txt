Problem Statement :

A classic problem in the field of pattern recognition is that of handwritten digit recognition.
Suppose that you have images of handwritten digits ranging from 0-9 written by various people in boxes of a specific size - similar to the application forms in banks and universities.

The goal is to develop a model that can correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image. 


Objective :

You are required to develop a model using Support Vector Machine which should correctly classify the handwritten digits from 0-9 based on the pixel values given as features.
Thus, this is a 10-class classification problem.
